# Code of Conduct

The Executable Book Project does not yet have a formal Code of Conduct committee and response process.
However, we do have an email to report Code of Conduct violations.
It is reviewed by the project's Code of Conduct Team, which is currently made up of the project's Principal Investigators.

Our Code of Conduct is based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), and located at the link below:

## Future plans

In the future we aim to create a more formal Code of Conduct reporting process and team of people to respond to CoC violations.
Please monitor and provide feedback in [the `meta/` repository](https://github.com/executablebooks/meta) as we explore the best path forward.
